## Overview

This project involves the analysis of a WhatsApp chat to uncover meaningful patterns and trends within the conversation. The data-driven approach includes preprocessing the chat data to extract user names, dates, and messages while categorizing data as either media or text sent. The cleaned data is then used to develop a Streamlit-based app, deployed on Render, making it easily accessible to a broader audience. The app allows users to obtain insights such as the most active user in the WhatsApp group or one-on-one chat, most used words and emojis, the member who sent the most media, the month of the year with the highest engagement, and the day of the week that was most engaging.

## Project Steps

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Extract user names, dates, and messages from the WhatsApp chat data.
   - Categorize data as media or text sent to differentiate between multimedia content and text messages.
   - Clean the data to remove any irrelevant or sensitive information.

2. Data Analysis:
   - Utilize the cleaned data to uncover meaningful patterns and trends within the conversation.
   - Perform statistical analysis to gain valuable insights into the chat dynamics.

3. Streamlit App Development:
   - Create a Streamlit-based app to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface.
   - Implement functionalities to enable users to explore the WhatsApp chat data easily.

4. Deployment:
   - Deploy the Streamlit app on Render to make it accessible to a broader audience.
   - Ensure the app is robust and efficient to handle concurrent users.
